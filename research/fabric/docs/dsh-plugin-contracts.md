# Standalone Fabric Workspace Contracts

This reference is shipped with the repository so planning, implementation, testing, and distribution use only guidance stored below the repository root.

## Repository boundary

All source, TypeScript configuration, test fixtures, skill instructions, and contributor guidance used by this repository live below the repository root. Describe repository files with project-root paths such as `docs/fabric.md`; parent-directory navigation is not valid documentation. Paths that leave the repository are not valid template inputs. Ordinary npm dependencies are allowed; a dependency is not a source or configuration file reference. Cross-package dependencies between the three workspace packages use the `workspace:^` protocol; every other dependency spec is registry-only.

A DSH host is a runtime consumer of the finished packages, not a development input. The host supplies the authoritative services the facades delegate to and applies the bundle carrier's patch when the repository is installed into a profile.

## Package boundary

The workspace contains exactly three complete packages — `cordis-fabric` (pure transformation service), `cordis-fabric-api` (pure compat facade), and `cordis-fabric-dsh` (DSH-facing facades, invariant, profile bootstrap). No fourth package may be added. Any code outside these three — including the official `@deepseek-ai/dsh-tool-cordis` toolset — is applied as a pnpm dependency patch stored in `patches/` and declared in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (see `patches/README.md`).

## Host contracts

The `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` host packages are installable from the npm registry. The facades in `packages/cordis-fabric-dsh/src` import their real types directly (declared as peer + dev dependencies), mirroring the upstream fabric split: `Agent` from `@deepseek-ai/dsh-agent`, `ToolDefinition`/`ToolExecution` from `@deepseek-ai/dsh-tools`, `PromptSection`/`PromptContext`/`AssembleContext` from `@deepseek-ai/dsh-system-prompt`, `CommandDefinition`/`CommandDescriptor` from `@deepseek-ai/dsh-commands`. Extend the imports only when a facade needs a new host surface, and keep them narrow.

## Plugin forms

A function plugin exports `name`, `inject`, `Config`, and `apply` as one ESM namespace and has no default export. A service plugin default-exports its `Service` subclass and follows the host service lifecycle. Do not combine the two loader forms. Required Cordis services belong in `inject`; optional services are read through named lookup.

## Lifecycle ownership

Every listener, registry entry, timer, watcher, child process, and callback registered by a plugin belongs to its Cordis fiber. Use effects or returned disposers and test removal after fiber disposal. Publish state and emit events only after the owning operation succeeds. A waterfall listener delegates by calling `next()`.

## Invariant companion

`cordis-fabric-dsh` exposes `./invariant` as a separate function plugin. Its installer checks an authoritative event or data relationship owned by the package. An empty installer is valid only when the package owns no observable relationship; explain that reason in the source. The companion resolves the host `invariants` service through the real `@deepseek-ai/dsh-invariants` types (peer dependency).

## Bundle composition

The workspace root `package.json` declares the bundle patch with `dsh.bundle.patch`. `cordis.patch.yml` inserts or overrides plugin rows (`cordis-fabric`, `cordis-fabric-dsh`, both disabled by default); it does not change source files, compiler settings, catalogs, or launcher code. An id-targeted override replaces the complete `config`, so retained fields must be restated. The row names must resolve through the consuming DSH profile.

## Evidence

The minimum package evidence includes a real Loader export-shape test, schema/default behavior, observable plugin behavior, and disposal. Host-facing facades additionally need real composition tests over the repository-local fakes in each package's `tests/fakes.ts`, and serve primitives need real HTTP evidence through the `cordis-fabric` test fakes. Typechecking, tests, and a development build are separate checks.

## Build and distribution

The development build is:

```sh
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm run build
```

The self-contained prepare build is:

```sh
pnpm run prepare
```

It emits declarations and runtime JavaScript for all three packages using only this repository's installed dependencies. `pnpm pack --dry-run --json` runs lifecycle scripts; inspect its final file list and restore a development build afterward when the pack lifecycle cleans or replaces generated files.

A package is ready for Git or npm only when every manifest-declared runtime and type entry exists after the relevant consumer lifecycle. Publishing, pushing, tagging, and registry operations remain separately authorized actions.
