/**
 * The Fabric runtime bridge — the single process-local entrypoint that
 * transformed target code calls. The bootstrap installs `publish` as a
 * `globalThis` handle; transformed code (ESM or CJS) emits
 * `globalThis[<key>].publish(call)` with no module import of its own.
 *
 * The bridge is deliberately tiny and Cordis-free: it carries no `Context`,
 * no registry state, and no knowledge of the target module. It is also
 * platform-free: dispatch runs through an in-memory listener set with no
 * `node:*` imports, so the same bridge serves the Node host and the browser
 * build (the runtime subscribes through {@link subscribeBridge}).
 * @module cordis-fabric/bridge
