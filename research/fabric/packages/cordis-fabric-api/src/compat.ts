/**
 * The Fabric compat adapter module: a patch-backed gap adapter that turns a
 * low-level Fabric transformation into a cooperative observation API.
 *
 * The adapter exists for target domains with no cooperative extension point
 * (no event, no registry): its targets are declared statically in the module
 * config and their instrumentations are installed by
 * {@link buildCompatInstrumentations} before the target module is loaded.
 * The public contract stays cooperative — `observe(name, listener)` — and
 * never exposes `FabricPatch`, AST selectors, file paths, or `invoke()`.
 * Target version drift leaves the adapter unavailable rather than pretending
 * compatibility: the installed instrumentation simply never matches, and the
 * service's diagnostics surface the declared target.
 * @module cordis-fabric-api/compat
