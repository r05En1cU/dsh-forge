/**
 * Browser half of `cordis-fabric`: a dshClient plugin entry
 * that installs the bridge handle and mounts the platform-free
 * `FabricService` in the browser Cordis tree.
 *
 * Client bundles are transformed at build time and their calls fall back to
 * the original body until this entry materializes and installs the bridge —
 * so a patch only takes effect for calls that happen after the browser
 * Fabric runtime is up. Patch handlers are registered by other browser
 * plugins through `ctx.fabric.register`.
 *
 * The exports are limited to platform-free faces (`../service.ts`,
 * `../bridge.ts`, `../runtime.ts`): the node half of this package imports
 * `node:*` modules and must never enter the browser bundle.
 * @module cordis-fabric/client
