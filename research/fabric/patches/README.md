# Dependency Patches

Place pnpm dependency patches in `patches/` only when an exact upstream package version must be corrected for this bundle.

Declare each patch in the project-root `pnpm-workspace.yaml`:

```yaml
patchedDependencies:
  'package-name@1.2.3': patches/package-name@1.2.3.patch
```

Keep the patch version exact, document why the patch is required, and remove it when the upstream dependency contains the fix. A patch that affects the Git prepare build must be present in source control and covered by clean-install, `pnpm run prepare`, and pack verification. Do not add an empty `patchedDependencies` block when the bundle has no patches.

## Package boundary

This workspace ships exactly three packages: `cordis-fabric`, `cordis-fabric-api`, and `cordis-fabric-dsh`. Anything else is never added as a fourth package. In particular, `@deepseek-ai/dsh-tool-cordis` is an official DeepSeek Harness package (its repository is `deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness`): it must not be republished or re-implemented here. When a behavior of an official package must change for this bundle, apply a pnpm patch through `patchedDependencies` exactly as above.

## Host integration patch

`fabric-host-integration.patch` carries the deepseek-harness host-side changes the three packages need in order to RUN. The three packages only know how to install hooks and mount facades; a DSH host at the pre-split snapshot does not call them, so the bundle would be inert without this patch.

The patch keeps only the seams the official plugin registration system cannot provide. Everything the official channels handle is deliberately excluded: installing the trio (`dsh plugin --profile <p> add github:dsh-external/fabric`), bundle roster rows and dependencies, catalog generation over the workspace, invariant/gate exemptions for trio-in-workspace, and documentation (`README*`, `docs/`, `.agents/`). The 17-file diff covers the seams only:

- `apps/cli/` — launcher wiring and bootstrap verification: `src/profile-boot.ts` calls `installFabricBootstrap` in the boot prepare phase (before any target module import) and `checkFabricRequiredPatches` after boot; `ProfileRows` becomes the fabric row type; `tests/fabric-bootstrap-*` and its fixture verify it; `package.json` wires the CLI build. The trio dependencies are git subdirectory specs (`github:dsh-external/fabric#main&path:/packages/...`), so a plain official checkout resolves and builds them on install (`prepare` runs on the consumer machine) without the trio living in the host workspace; the removed project references let TypeScript resolve the trio types from `node_modules`.
- `packages/client/tsdown.client.ts` — the `clientBundle` opt-in source `transform` (the browser build seam; `dsh.client` has no transform field, so the host build tool must expose it).
- `packages/extensions/tool-cordis/src/api-catalog.ts` — the official package's catalog entries for the fabric services and types; the catalog is compiled into the official package with no runtime registration path, so the entries must be patched in.
- `scripts/` — host-side seam tests (`client-bundle-source-transform.spec.ts`, `dev-web-fabric.spec.ts`).
- `tsconfig.host.json` / `tsconfig.client.json` (include/exclude the new seam spec), `knip.json` and `.gitignore` (the `apps/cli` bootstrap fixture), and `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (`dangerouslyAllowAllBuilds: true` — pnpm 11 allowBuilds only accepts exact `git+url#commit` keys for git installs, so the trio's prepare builds are allowed wholesale; the lockfile changes because the CLI gains two git deps, so the first install runs with `--no-frozen-lockfile`).
- `packages/boot/app-boot/src/profile.ts` — the pnpm settings template gains `blockExoticSubdeps: false` (pnpm 11 blocks git-resolved subdependencies by default, and the carrier's trio arrives through git specs). Applies to newly initialized profiles only — dsh never overwrites existing profile files.
- `packages/bundle/web-app/cordis.patch.yml` — the bundle patch inserts the `cordis-fabric` / `cordis-fabric-dsh` rows as disabled opt-ins (the pure `cordis-fabric` package has no plugin `apply`, so an enabled row fails every boot). The bundle layer applies on every boot (including profiles initialized before the patch, whose files dsh never touches), and the trio resolves from the source worktree's `node_modules` through the CLI's git deps — no bundle registration or profile edit needed; a profile opts in by enabling the rows.

Apply it from a deepseek-harness checkout that lacks the wiring (works on the pinned snapshot `9f9e2782a4` (0813) and the current official main):

```sh
git apply patches/fabric-host-integration.patch
```

or with the applier (idempotent: detects hosts that already contain the wiring):

```sh
pnpm run patch:host -- <deepseek-harness-checkout>
```

The bundle itself installs through the official plugin channel: `dsh plugin --profile <p> add github:dsh-external/fabric`.

A source host is fully functional after this flow (the trio resolves through the CLI's git specs and builds itself on `pnpm install`):

```sh
git clone <deepseek-harness> && cd deepseek-harness
git apply <this-patch>            # or: pnpm run patch:host -- .
pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile # first install: lockfile gains the two git deps,
                                  # pulls the trio from GitHub and runs its prepare build
pnpm run build                    # build the CLI and client bundles
pnpm dsh web            # the web-app bundle layer already composes the fabric rows
```

A host that already contains the wiring (the fork at `65bcaf9902` or later) needs nothing. An npm-installed official `dsh` cannot take the patch (its CLI ships prebuilt); those hosts work once the official repository merges the wiring.

Regenerate the patch with the extraction script instead of by hand — it reproduces the seam-only diff mechanically (worktree at the upstream commit, reverts the registry-handled files to the baseline, applies the seam edits, excludes trio and documentation, and verifies forward and reverse apply). The values live in `patches/host-patch.config.json`:

```sh
pnpm run extract:patch -- --harness <fork-checkout>
```

The `--harness` checkout must contain both snapshots (the fork worktree, e.g. the `feat-fabric` branch). The script fails loud when a seam anchor has drifted upstream.
